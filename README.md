# Dev10 Prework
This repository contains assessments done as a part of the application process for Genesis10's Dev10 program. As part of the application process, we are required to complete a series of lessons and assessments on HTML, CSS, version control, JavaScript, and Java. Below are brief descriptions of the assessments:
* `HTML_BasicCSS_Assessment`: using HTML and CSS, we recreated a design provided by the assessment
* `CSS_Assessment`: using HTML and CSS with a focus on floats, we recreated a design provided by the assessment
* `Bootstrap_Assessment`: using Bootstrap and focusing on responsiveness, we recreated the same design as `HTML_BasicCSS_Assessment` while adding other components to our liking
* `Module-1_Assessment`: using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, we created three HTML files ("About Me", "Contact Me", and "Portolio Gallery" pages) based on a theme provided by sample screenshots and additional specifications provided in the assessment
* `JavaScript_Basic_Assessment`: solved a series of problems that reviewed basic JavaScript concepts (math operations, alerts/prompts, loops, etc.)
* `Module-2_Assessment`: created a [word guess game](/Module-2_Assessment/README.md) using JavaScript
