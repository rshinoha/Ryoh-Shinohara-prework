#  Name the Formula 1 Driver Game
This is a word guess game that prompts users to guess a Formula 1 driver's last name based on an image. The player is given 5 guesses to type the driver's name. Incorrectly guessed letters will only be counted once, and non-letters (numbers, symbols, etc.) will not be counted at all. After the player correctly answers the driver name or if the player uses up their guesses, the player is prompted to press enter to move on to the next image.
